I will analyze data taken from a typical experiment in medical science. The example data is taken from a microarray experiment,

1. The experiment contains totally 8 samples - clumps of human cells.
2. 4 samples have been treated with a chemical, and 4 are non-treated controls.
3. There are approximately 22000 variables measured on each sample.

So, in summary, there are 4+4 columns of samples times 22000 rows of variables.
What I will be finding out is which, if any, of all these 22000 variables is changing (or regulated) significantly as a result of the experiment.

In a microarray experiment the variables measured are usually called "probes", "genes" or "features", and each measured value is often called and "expression" value.
